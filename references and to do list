set up a tag system for activating stat boosts from weapons/artifacts/talents

set up which characters can enable which tags (furina enables hurting, geo characters enable crystallize1, electro pyro hydro cryo enable crystallize2, same with swirl)

set up single character optimization single hit (artifacts only) (use Rcpp for this)
